        A wise child brings joy to a father, a foolish child brings grief to a mother. (10:1) <br><br>
        Evil people will surely be punished, but the children of the godly will go free. (11:21)<br><br>
        Those who bring liouble on their families inherit the wind. The fool will be a servant to the wise. (11:29)<br><br>
        A worthy wife is a crown for her husband, but a disgraceful woman is like cancer in his bones. (12:4) <br> <br>
        A wise child accepts a parent's discipline; a mocker refuses to listen to correction. (13:1) <br> <br>
        Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them. (13:24) <br> <br>
        A wise woman builds her home, but a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands. (14:1) <br> <br>
        Only a fool despises a parent's discipline; whoever learns from correction is wise. (15:5) <br> <br>
        Sensible children bring joy to their father; foolish children despise their mother. (15:20) <br> <br>
        Better a dry crust eaten in peace than a house filled with feasting-and conflict. (17:1) <br> <br>
        A wise servant will rule over the master's disgraceful son and will share the inheritance of the master's children. (17:2) <br> <br>
        Grandchildren are the crowning glory of the aged; parents are the pride of their children. (17:6) <br> <br>
        A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need. (17:17) <br> <br>
        It is painful to be the parent of a fool; there is no joy for the father of a rebel. (17:21) <br> <br>
        Foolish children bring grief to their father and bitterness to the one who gave them birth. (17:25) <br> <br>
