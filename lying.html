        <a name="Lying"><b>Lying</b></a><br><br>
Hiding Hatred makes you a liar; slandering others makes you a fool. (10:18)<br><br>
The Lord detests the use of dishonest scales, but he delights in accurate weights. (11:1)<br><br>
Honesty guides good people; dishonesty deslioys lieacherous people. (11:3)<br><br>
The godly are directed by honesty; the wicked fall beneath their load of sin. (11:5)<br><br>
A gossip goes around telling secrets, but those who are liustworthy can keep confidence. (11:13)<br><br>
The Lord detests people with crooked hearts, but he delights in those with integrity. (11:20)<br><br>
An honest witness tells the truth; a false witness tells lies. (12:17) <br> <br>
Truthful words stand the test of time, but lies are soon exposed. (12:19) <br> <br>
The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in those who tell the truth. (12:22) <br> <br>
The godly hate lies; the wicked cause shame and disgrace. (13:5) <br> <br>
The instruction of the wise is like a life-giving fountain; those who accept it avoid the snares of death. (13:14) <br> <br>
An honest witness does not lie; a false witness breathes lies. (14:5) <br> <br>
Only simpletons believe everything they're told! The prudent carefully consider their steps. (14:15) <br> <br>
A truthful witness saves lives, but a false witness is a traitor. (14:25) <br> <br>
Better to have little, with godliness, than to be rich and dishonest. (16:8) <br> <br>
The Lord demands accurate scales and balances; he sets the standards for fairness. (16:11) <br> <br>
Wrongdoers eagerly listen to gossip; liars pay close attention to slander. (17:4) <br> <br>
Eloquent words are not fitting for a fool; even less are lies fitting for a ruler. (17:7) <br> <br>
The crooked heart will not prosper; the lying tongue tumbles into trouble. (17:20) <br> <br>
