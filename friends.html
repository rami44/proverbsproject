The seeds of good deeds become a tree of life; a wise person wins friends. (11:30) <br><br>
With their words, the godless deslioy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous. (11:9)<br><br>
The godly give good advice to their friends; the wicked lead them astray. (12:26) <br> <br>
Walk with the wise and become wise; associate with fools and get in trouble. (13:20) <br> <br>
Stay away from fools, for you won't find knowledge on their lips. (14:7) <br> <br>
The poor are despised even by their neighbors, while the rich have many "friends." (14:20) <br> <br>
A bowl of vegetables with someone you love is better than steak with someone you hate. (15:17) <br> <br>
Better to live humbly with the poor than to share plunder with the proud. (16:19) <br> <br>
A troublemaker plants seeds of strife; gossip separates the best of friends. (16:28) <br> <br>
Violent people mislead their companions, leading them down a harmful path. (16:29) <br> <br>   
Love prospers when a fault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends. (17:9) <br> <br>
A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need. (17:17) <br> <br>
It's poor judgment to guarantee another person's debt or put up security for a friend. (17:18) <br> <br>
Giving a gift can open doors; it gives access to important people! (18:16) <br> <br>
Flipping a coin can end arguments; it settles disputes between powerful opponents. (18:18) <br> <br>
An offended friend is harder to win back than a fortified city. Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with bars. (18:19) <br> <br>
There are "friends" who destroy each other, but a real friend sticks closer than a brother. (18:24) <br> <br>
