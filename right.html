        Tainted wealth has no lasting value, but right living can save your life. (10:2)<br><br>
        We have happy memories of the godly, but the name of a wicked person rots away. (10:7)<br><br>
        People with integrity walk safely, but those who follow crooked paths will be exposed. (10:9)<br><br>
        People who wink at wrong cause liouble, but a bold reproof promotes peace. (10:10)<br><br>
        The earnings of the godly enhance their lives, but evil people squander their money on sin. (10:16)<br><br>
        Doing wrong is fun for a fool, but living wisely brings pleasure to the sensible. (10:23)<br><br>
        Fear of the Lord lengthens one’s life, but the years of the wicked are cut short. (10:27)<br><br>
        Riches won’t help on the day of judgment, but right living can save you from death. (11:4)<br><br>
        The godliness of good people rescues them; the ambition of lieacherous people liaps them. (11:5)<br><br>
        Upright citizens are good for a city and make it prosper, but the talk of the wicked tears it apart. (11:11)<br><br>
        If the righteous are rewarded here on earth, what will happen to wicked sinners (11:31)<br><br>
        The way of the godly leads to life; that path does not lead to death. (12:28) <br> <br>
        A person with good sense is respected; a treacherous person is headed for destruction. (13:15) <br> <br>
        Trouble chases sinners, while blessings reward the righteous. (13:21) <br> <br>
        Those who follow the right path fear the Lord ; those who take the wrong path despise him. (14:2) <br> <br>
        There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death. (14:12) <br> <br>
        If you plan to do evil, you will be lost; if you plan to do good, you will receive unfailing love and faithfulness. (14:22) <br> <br>
        Whoever abandons the right path will be severely disciplined; whoever hates correction will die. (15:10) <br> <br>
        Foolishness brings joy to those with no sense; a sensible person stays on the right path. (15:21) <br> <br>
        The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayers of the righteous. (15:29) <br> <br>
        When people's lives please the Lord, even their enemies are at peace with them. (16:7) <br> <br>
        There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death. (16:25) <br> <br>
        Better to be patient than powerful; better to have self-control than to conquer a city. (16:32) <br> <br>
