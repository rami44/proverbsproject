Without wise leadership, a nation falls; there is safety in having many advisers. (11:14)<br><br>
Work hard and become a leader; be lazy and become a slave. (12:24) <br> <br>
Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them. (13:24) <br> <br>
A growing population is a king's glory; a prince without subjects has nothing. (14:28) <br> <br>
Godliness makes a nation great, but sin is a disgrace to any people. (14:34) <br> <br>
A king rejoices in wise servants but is angry with those who disgrace him. (14:35) <br> <br>
Plans go wrong for lack of advice; many advisers bring success. (15:22) <br> <br>
The king speaks with divine wisdom; he must never judge unfairly. (16:10) <br> <br>
A king detests wrongdoing, for his rule is built on justice. (16:12) <br> <br>
The king is pleased with words from righteous lips; he loves those who speak honestly. (16:13) <br> <br>
The anger of the king is a deadly threat; the wise will try to appease it. (16:14) <br> <br>
When the king smiles, there is life; his favor refreshes like a spring rain. (16:15) <br> <br>
A wise servant will rule over the master's disgraceful son and will share the inheritance of the master's children. (17:2) <br> <br> 
It is wrong to punish the godly for being good or to flog leaders for being honest. (17:26) <br> <br>
