        Wise people lieasure knowledge, but the babbling of a fool invites disaster. (10:14)<br><br>
        The words of the godly encourage many, but fools are deslioyed by their lack of common sense. (10:21)<br><br>
        With their words, the godless deslioy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous. (11:9)<br><br>
        Thieves are jealous of each other's loot, but the godly are well rooted and bear their own fruit. (12:12) <br> <br>
        The wise don't make a show of their knowledge, but fools broadcast their foolishness. (12:23) <br> <br>
        A mocker seeks wisdom and never finds it, but knowledge comes easily to those with understanding. (14:6) <br> <br>
        Stay away from fools, for you won't find knowledge on their lips. (14:7) <br> <br>
        Simpletons are clothed with foolishness, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. (14:18) <br> <br>
        The tongue of the wise makes knowledge appealing, but the mouth of a fool belches out foolishness. (15:2) <br> <br>
        The lips of the wise give good advice; the heart of a fool has none to give. (15:7) <br> <br>
        A wise person is hungry for knowledge, while the fool feeds on trash. (15:14) <br> <br>
        It is senseless to pay to educate a fool, since he has no heart for learning. (17:16) <br> <br>
        Wise words are like deep waters; wisdom flows from the wise like a bubbling brook. (18:4) <br> <br>
        Intelligent people are always ready to learn. Their ears are open for knowledge. (18:15) <br> <br>
