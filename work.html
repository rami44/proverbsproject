        A wise youth harvests in the summer, but one who sleeps during harvest is a disgrace. (10:5)<br><br>
        Lazy people are soon poor; hard workers get rich. (10:4)<br><br>
        Lazy people irritate their employers, like vinegar to the teeth or smoke in the eyes. (10:26) <br><br>
        A hard worker has plenty of food, but a person who chases fantasies has no sense. (12:11) <br> <br>
        Thieves are jealous of each other's loot, but the godly are well rooted and bear their own fruit. (12:12) <br> <br>
        Wise words bring many benefits, and hard work brings rewards. (12:14) <br> <br>
        Work hard and become a leader; be lazy and become a slave. (12:24) <br> <br>
        Lazy people don't even cook the game they catch, but the diligent make use of everything they find. (12:27) <br> <br>
        Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper. (13:4) <br> <br>
        Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears; wealth from hard work grows over time. (13:11) <br> <br>
        A poor person's farm may produce much food, but injustice sweeps it all away. (13:23) <br> <br>
        Without oxen a stable stays clean, but you need a strong ox for a large harvest. (14:4) <br> <br>
        Work brings profit, but mere talk leads to poverty! (14:23) <br> <br>
        A lazy person's way is blocked with briers, but the path of the upright is an open highway. (15:19) <br> <br>
        It is good for workers to have an appetite; an empty stomach drives them on. (16:26) <br> <br>
        A lazy person is as bad as someone who destroys things. (18:9) <br> <br>
