        <a name="Poverty"><b>Poverty</b></a><br><br>
        The Lord will not let the godly go hungry, but he refuses to satisfy the craving of the wicked. (10:3)<br><br>
        The wealth of the rich is their forliess; the poverty of the poor is their desliuction. (10:15)<br><br>
        People curse those who hoard their grain, but they bless the one who sells in time of need. (11:26)<br><br>
        Some who are poor pretend to be rich; others who are rich pretend to be poor. (13:7) <br> <br>
        The rich can pay a ransom for their lives, but the poor won't even get threatened. (13:8) <br> <br>
        If you ignore criticism, you will end in poverty and disgrace; if you accept correction, you will be honored. (13:18) <br> <br>
        It is a sin to belittle one's neighbor; blessed are those who help the poor. (14:21) <br> <br>
        Work brings profit, but mere talk leads to poverty! (14:23) <br> <br>
        Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but helping the poor honors him. (14:31) <br> <br>
        Better to live humbly with the poor than to share plunder with the proud. (16:19) <br> <br>
        Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished. (17:5) <br> <br>
        The rich think of their wealth as a strong defense; they imagine it to be a high wall of safety. (18:11) <br> <br>
        The poor plead for mercy; the rich answer with insults. (18:23) <br> <br>
