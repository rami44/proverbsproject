        The wise are glad to be insliucted, but babbling fools fall flat on their faces. (10:8) <br><br>
        People who accept discipline are on the pathway to life, but those who ignore correction will go asliay. (10:17)<br><br>
        Pride leads to disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. (11:2)<br><br>
        To learn, you must love discipline; it is stupid to hate correction. (12:1) <br> <br>
        A sensible person wins admiration, but a warped mind is despised. (12:8) <br> <br>
        Better to be an ordinary person with a servant than to be self-important but have no food. (12:9) <br> <br>
        Fools think their own way is right, but the wise listen to others. (12:15) <br></br>
        A wise child accepts a parent's discipline; a mocker refuses to listen to correction. (13:1) <br> <br>
        Pride leads to conflict; those who take advice are wise. (13:10) <br> <br>
        People who despise advice are asking for trouble; those who respect a command will succeed. (13:13) <br> <br>
        If you ignore criticism, you will end in poverty and disgrace; if you accept correction, you will be honored. (13:18) <br> <br>
        A fool's proud talk becomes a rod that beats him, but the words of the wise keep them safe. (14:3) <br> <br>
        Simpletons are clothed with foolishness, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. (14:18) <br> <br>
        It is a sin to belittle one's neighbor; blessed are those who help the poor. (14:21) <br> <br>
        Mockers hate to be corrected, so they stay away from the wise. (15:12) <br> <br>
        The Lord tears down the house of the proud, but he protects the property of widows. (15:25) <br> <br>
        If you listen to constructive criticism, you will be at home among the wise. (15:31) <br> <br>
        If you reject discipline, you only harm yourself; but if you listen to correction, you grow in understanding. (15:32) <br> <br>
        Fear of the Lord teaches wisdom; humility precedes honor. (15:33) <br> <br>
        The Lord detests the proud; they will surely be punished. (16:5) <br> <br>
        Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall. (16:18) <br> <br>
        Better to live humbly with the poor than to share plunder with the proud. (16:19) <br> <br>
        We may throw the dice, but the Lord determines how they fall. (16:33) <br> <br>
        Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished. (17:5) <br> <br>
        Grandchildren are the crowning glory of the aged; parents are the pride of their children. (17:6) <br> <br>
        Fools have no interest in understanding; they only want to air their own opinions. (18:2) <br> <br>
        Haughtiness goes before destruction; humility precedes honor. (18:12) <br> <br>
