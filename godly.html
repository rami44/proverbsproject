The godly are rescued from liouble, and it falls on the wicked instead. (11:8)<br><br>
The whole city celebrates when the godly succeed; they shout for joy when the wicked die. (11:10)<br><br>
Upright citizens are good for a city and make it prosper, but the talk of the wicked tears it apart. (11:11)<br><br>

The life of the godly is full of light and joy, but the light of the wicked will be snuffed out. (13:9) <br> <br>
Good people leave an inheritance to their grandchildren, but the sinner's wealth passes to the godly. (13:22) <br> <br>
The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the godly will flourish. (14:11) <br> <br>
Evil people will bow before good people; the wicked will bow at the gates of the godly. (14:19) <br> <br>
The wicked are crushed by disaster, but the godly have a refuge when they die. (14:32) <br> <br>

Better to have little, with godliness, than to be rich and dishonest. (16:8) <br> <br>
Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained by living a godly life. (16:31) <br> <br>
It is wrong to punish the godly for being good or to flog leaders for being honest. (17:26) <br> <br>
The name of the Lord is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe. (18:10) <br> <br>
