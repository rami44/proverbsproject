        <a name="Fool"><b>Fool</b></a><br><br>
        The wise are glad to be insliucted, but babbling fools fall flat on their faces (10:8) <br><br>
        Wise people lieasure knowledge, but the babbling of a fool invites disaster. (10:14)<br><br>
        The words of the godly are like sterling silver; the heart of a fool is worthless. (10:20)<br><br>
        The words of the godly encourage many, but fools are deslioyed by their lack of common sense. (10:21)<br><br>
        Doing wrong is fun for a fool, but living wisely brings pleasure to the sensible. (10:23)<br><br>
        It is foolish to belittle one's neighbor; a sensible person keeps quiet. (11:12)<br><br>
        Fools think their own way is right, but the wise listen to others. (12:15) <br></br>
        A fool is quick-tempered, but a wise person stays calm when insulted. (12:16) <br> <br>
        The wise don't make a show of their knowledge, but fools broadcast their foolishness. (12:23) <br> <br>
        Wise people think before they act; fools don't-and even brag about their foolishness. (13:16) <br> <br>
        It is pleasant to see dreams come true, but fools refuse to turn from evil to attain them. (13:19) <br> <br>
        Trouble chases sinners, while blessings reward the righteous. (13:21) <br> <br>
        Stay away from fools, for you won't find knowledge on their lips. (14:7) <br> <br>
        The prudent understand where they are going, but fools deceive themselves. (14:8) <br> <br>
        Fools make fun of guilt, but the godly acknowledge it and seek reconciliation. (14:9) <br> <br>
        Only simpletons believe everything they're told! The prudent carefully consider their steps. (14:15) <br> <br>
        The wise are cautious and avoid danger; fools plunge ahead with reckless confidence. (14:16) <br> <br>
        Short-tempered people do foolish things, and schemers are hated. (14:17) <br> <br>
        Simpletons are clothed with foolishness, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. (14:18) <br> <br>
        Wealth is a crown for the wise; the effort of fools yields only foolishness. (14:24) <br> <br>
        Wisdom is enshrined in an understanding heart; wisdom is not found among fools. (14:33) <br> <br>
        The tongue of the wise makes knowledge appealing, but the mouth of a fool belches out foolishness. (15:2) <br> <br>
        The lips of the wise give good advice; the heart of a fool has none to give. (15:7) <br> <br>
        A wise person is hungry for knowledge, while the fool feeds on trash. (15:14) <br> <br>
        Foolishness brings joy to those with no sense; a sensible person stays on the right path. (15:21) <br> <br>
        The path of life leads upward for the wise; they leave the grave behind. (15:24) <br> <br>
        If you listen to constructive criticism, you will be at home among the wise. (15:31) <br> <br>
        Fear of the Lord teaches wisdom; humility precedes honor. (15:33) <br> <br>
        How much better to get wisdom than gold, and good judgment than silver! (16:16) <br> <br>
        The wise are known for their understanding, and pleasant words are persuasive. (16:21) <br> <br>
        Discretion is a life-giving fountain to those who possess it, but discipline is wasted on fools. (16:22) <br> <br>
        From a wise mind comes wise speech; the words of the wise are persuasive. (16:23) <br> <br>
        A wise servant will rule over the master's disgraceful son and will share the inheritance of the master's children. (17:2) <br> <br>
        Eloquent words are not fitting for a fool; even less are lies fitting for a ruler. (17:7) <br> <br>
        A single rebuke does more for a person of understanding than a hundred lashes on the back of a fool. (17:10) <br> <br>
        It is safer to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than to confront a fool caught in foolishness. (17:12) <br> <br>
        It is senseless to pay to educate a fool, since he has no heart for learning. (17:16) <br> <br>
        Sensible people keep their eyes glued on wisdom, but a fool's eyes wander to the ends of the earth. (17:24) <br> <br>
        Foolish children bring grief to their father and bitterness to the one who gave them birth. (17:25) <br> <br>
        A truly wise person uses few words; a person with understanding is even-tempered. (17:27) <br> <br>
        Even fools are thought wise when they keep silent; with their mouths shut, they seem intelligent. (17:28) <br> <br>
        Fools have no interest in understanding; they only want to air their own opinions. (18:2) <br> <br>
        Wise words are like deep waters; wisdom flows from the wise like a bubbling brook. (18:4) <br> <br>
        Fools' words get them into constant quarrels; they are asking for a beating. (18:6) <br> <br>
        The mouths of fools are their ruin; they trap themselves with their lips. (18:7) <br> <br>
        Spouting off before listening to the facts is both shameful and foolish. (18:13) <br> <br>
